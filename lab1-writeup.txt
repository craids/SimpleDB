Lab 1

1. Design decisions

Cache-based computations or pre-computation is used in some places. 
For example, name-to-index calculations in TupleDesc and Catalog are lazily stored in 
java.util.Map, and in the HeapFileIterator next() method, after returning a Tuple, 
it calculates the next Tuple.

2. Changes made to the API

None.

3. Missing or incomplete elements of your code

All parts for lab 1 done.

4. Time spent on the lab, and whether there was anything you
found particularly difficult or confusing.

7 hours.  Implementing BufferPool, HeapPage and HeapFile (esp. BufferPool), 
was pretty confusing.  It was unclear which readPage methods should be using which other
ones, and who should be directly accessing disk, and how. 

The control flow hopefully could be simplified, or if not some of the hints given on Piazza
could be included with the lab hand-out.

Other than that, any confusion that came up during the lab was covered very
thoroughly by the lab hand-out and/or the Javadocs.
